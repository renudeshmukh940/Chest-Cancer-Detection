# Chest-Cancer-Detection
In the relentless pursuit of advancing medical diagnostics and treatment, the intersection of technology and healthcare has given rise to innovative solutions. This project endeavors to contribute to the early detection of adenocarcinoma, a common type of cancer, through the application of Image Classification using Machine Learning (ML) techniques.

Adenocarcinoma, characterized by abnormal cell growth in glandular tissues, poses a significant health challenge worldwide. Early detection is paramount for successful intervention and improved patient outcomes. Leveraging the power of ML, this project aims to enhance the diagnostic process by automating the analysis of medical images, providing a faster and potentially more accurate assessment.

This project spans the entire ML pipeline, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and user interaction. The end-to-end nature ensures a comprehensive solution that addresses the complexities of adenocarcinoma detection.

In conclusion, this adenocarcinoma cancer detection project demonstrates the convergence of cutting-edge technologies, machine learning algorithms, and cloud computing to contribute to the advancement of medical diagnostics. By providing an end-to-end solution, it aims to make a meaningful impact on the early detection and management of adenocarcinoma, ultimately improving patient outcomes and advancing the field of healthcare technology.

### Modular Coding

The project follows a modular coding approach, promoting code maintainability and scalability. Each component is encapsulated in modular units, facilitating easy updates, debugging, and collaborative development.

### Project WorkFlows...

    1. Update config.yaml
    2. Update params.yaml
    3. Update the entity
    4. Updaye the configuration manager in src config
    5. Update the components
    6. Update the Pipeline
    7. Update the main.py
    8. Update the dvc.yaml



### Flask/Streamlit for UI

To bridge the gap between the ML model and end-users, a user-friendly interface is essential. Flask or Streamlit, popular Python web frameworks, are integrated to provide an intuitive and interactive platform for users to input medical images and receive timely and accurate predictions.

# AWS-CICD-Deployment-with-Github-Actions

## 1. Login to AWS console.

## 2. Create IAM user for deployment

    #with specific access

    1. EC2 access : It is virtual machine

    2. ECR: Elastic Container registry to save your docker image in aws


    #Description: About the deployment

    1. Build docker image of the source code

    2. Push your docker image to ECR

    3. Launch Your EC2

    4. Pull Your image from ECR in EC2

    5. Lauch your docker image in EC2

    #Policy:

    1. AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess

    2. AmazonEC2FullAccess

## 3. Create ECR repo to store/save docker image

    - Save the URI: 259588875913.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/chest_cancer_classifier

## 4. Create EC2 machine (Ubuntu)

## 5. Open EC2 and Install docker in EC2 Machine:

    #optinal

    sudo apt-get update -y

    sudo apt-get upgrade

    #required

    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

    sudo sh get-docker.sh

    sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

    newgrp docker

# 6. Configure EC2 as self-hosted runner:

    setting>actions>runner>new self hosted runner> choose os> then run command one by one

# 7. Setup github secrets:

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=

    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

    AWS_REGION = us-east-1

    AWS_ECR_LOGIN_URI = demo>>  566373416292.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

    ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME = simple-app
